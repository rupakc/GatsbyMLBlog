Though quite useful in selected multi-modal domains, its potential applications are throttled by the data bottleneck.\n  In most practical ML applications all you need is a <b> swiss army knife </b> and not a <b> hammer </b>. <br/>\n  I am not afraid to call a spade a spade. Hence, this blog is an attempt to give a glimpse of Machine Learning from the first principles.\n  The blog is organized in an easy to follow structure with a focus on the basics first and then slowly transitioning to more advanced topics.`,\n\n  introductionText: `Machine Learning is a sub-field of <b> A.I.(Aritificial Intelligence) </b>. It stands on the sturdy and able shoulders of\n  several mathematical paradigms like <b><i> Inferential Statistics, Probability, Convex Optimization and Multivariate Calculus </i></b> among others.\n  In simple words it uses data to teach computers the art of making predictions. The data used for teaching the machines is popularly known as\n  <b> training data </b> (no points here for guessing) and the efficacy of the trained model is tested on the unseen data. <br/>\n  Mathematical models form the crux of these Machine Learning algorithms. These are the workhorse of all the optimizations and approximations\n  which drive almost all popular and useful algorithms today. The various flavours of Machine Learning can be broadly categorized as - `,\n\n  typesOfML: [\"<b> Supervised Learning </b> - Classification & Regression are popular approaches to this, where the learning agent is provided a set of labeled examples to learn from.\",\n  \"<b> Unsupervised Learning </b> - Clustering is the de-facto approach to unsupervised learning. The data is devoid of any labeled classes hence, algorithms aim to detect hidden patterns in the data.\",\n  \"<b> Semi-Supervised Learning </b> - Combines the best of both worlds (i.e. Supervised and Unsupervised). <b> Label Propagation </b> is its flag-bearer.\",\n  \"<b> Active Learning </b> - Basically a clever way to select most informative exemplars from the dataset to train on.\",\n  \"<b> Reinforcement Learning </b> - The closest paradigm to learning in the real-world where the learning agent is given scores for its actions in a given learning environment.\",\n  \"<b> One Shot/Zero Shot/Few Shot Learning </b> - The agent is taught to generalize from a set of very few labelled examples which strongly correlate to the end task.\",\n  \"<b> Transfer Learning </b> - Transfer the knowledge of one domain to another, the learning tasks have to be closely related for this to work effectively.\",\n  \"<b> Self Supervised Learning </b> - This provides an ingenious way to modify the input space in order to learn non-trivial relations and structures inherent in the input space.\",\n  \"<b> Multi-task Learning </b> - Learning several complementary, closely related tasks together so that they can all benefit each other.\",\n  \"<b> Knowledge Distillation </b> - Rose out of the needs to compress the knowledge of gargantuan models (several million parameters) to a couple of thousand parameters. This follows the <b> student-teacher network </b> paradigm.\",\n  \"<b> Deep Learning </b> - Supervised Learning based on Neural Networks, using the ubiquitous backpropagation algorithm and its many variants.\",\n  \"<b> Lifelong Learning </b> - As the name suggests these class of algorithms continually and incrementally adjust their parameters and keep in learning, there is no demarcated training and testing phase.\"],\n\n  basicText: `Machine Learning can be boiled down to its three main pillars as enshrined by <b> Pedro Domingoes </b>. These are - <b> Representation </b>, <b> Evaluation </b> and <b> Optimization </b>.\n  Representation is the first and all important part, this involves how to decompose the problem at hand into a set of actionable feature sets which encode the domain knowledge. Next comes Evaluation,\n  this measures the efficacy of the trained model usually done on a held out dataset (test data). Each approach (classfication, regression, clustering etc.) has its own set of evaluation metrics and\n  chosing the right metric makes life a lot easier. <br/>\n  Optimization is where the magic happens, this finetunes the parameters of the model according to the data and evaluation function provided. There are many variants of this which are mostly used -\n  <b> Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Expectation Maximization, Gradient Descent </b> etc.` ,\n\n  advancedText: `There are hundreds of different algorithms in Machine Learning and new ones are being introduced every day. However, all of these have a grounding or are somehow based on a set of core and most widely used algorithms.\n  These set of algorithms is the bare minimum any practioner should know. They span all the three important realms of Machine Learning - Classification, Clustering and Regression. Reinforcement Learning algorithms have been left out\n  because they involve a whole different ball game. So has been other popular approaches like Genetic algorithms and Probabilistic Graphical Models. <br/>\n  With the exception of <b> Logistic Regression </b> all the algorithms which one is bound to use on a daily basis have been mentioned here.`,\n\n  basicCardJsonList:[\n    {\n      heading: \"Train/Test/Validation Split\" ,\n      description: `The data is often divided into two or sometimes three mutually exclusive and exhaustive parts.\n      One part of the data (training data) is used to tune the parameters of the model.
